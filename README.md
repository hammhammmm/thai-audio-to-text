- Try using Chrome or Firefox browsers
- Ensure microphone is not being used by other applications

**3. "Model download fails"**
- Check internet connection
- Try switching to a different model
- Clear browser cache and restart the app

**4. "Out of memory" errors**
- Close other applications
- Try using a smaller model
- Use "Simple Progress" method
- Process shorter audio files

**5. "Conversion is very slow"**
- Use GPU acceleration if available:
  ```bash
  pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
  ```
- Choose faster models like "Whisper (English)"
- Use "Simple Progress" method
